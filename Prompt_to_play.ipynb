            "A fluffy white bunny rabbit, with long ears and a twitching nose, hops playfully through a vibrant, sun-drenched English garden.  The garden is bursting with color: bright red roses climb a weathered stone wall, lavender bushes sway gently in a soft breeze, and plump, juicy strawberries peek from beneath lush green leaves.  Butterflies flutter around the bunny as it nibbles on a clover, its whiskers quivering. The animation should depict the bunny hopping from one point of interest to another within the garden over the course of approximately 5 seconds, with a smooth, almost cartoonish, style.  The background should be softly blurred to emphasize the bunny.  The overall mood should be cheerful and whimsical, with a focus on the bunny's adorable movements and the beauty of the garden. The lighting should be warm and inviting, like a summer afternoon.  The animation should loop seamlessly.\n",
